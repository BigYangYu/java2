# CS209A-Final-Project-Demo

This is SUSTech CS209A 2023 Fall course final project demo for students, including a StackOverflow data analysis and visualization web page based on SpringBoot and HTML.

## Preface

This is just a sample demo with a small amount of data and trivial visualization, and you need to **collect data** according to the document and **design a more beautiful view** by yourself. This demo is to help you to understand the main structure of the code and provide quick start, and you can also redesign it without using this demo.

The data in this demo is from 50 Java threads in StackOverflow, which are the top 50 ones with the most activity collected on Nov. 19, 2023. The demo is a SpringBoot project with Maven as the package manager. The project uses SpringBoot version 3.1.5, and the default JDK version is 20. In addition, the  thymeleaf template engine ([see the documentation for more details](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)) is imported for page rendering. The frontend and backend of this demo  are not separated (you can create a separate front-end and back-end  project), and the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript (you can use  Vue, React, or other front-end frameworks). The echarts framework for  generating wordcloud and piechart is imported via CDN ([see the documentation for more details](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)).
